#ABCD Dataset Modeling
This project demonstrates the development of two deep learning models — a Transformer and an LSTM — applied to the ABCD dataset, which includes both time series and cross-sectional data.

Project Summary
Built custom LSTM and Transformer models to analyze complex sequential and cross-sectional data.

Focused on extracting meaningful patterns from temporal and snapshot data in the ABCD dataset.

Dataset is private and not included.

Models
LSTM: Captures temporal dependencies in the data.

Transformer: Uses attention mechanisms to model relationships across sequences.

Results
Achieved strong predictive performance (details confidential due to dataset privacy).
