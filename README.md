# Neuroscience Dataset Modeling

This project demonstrates the development of two deep learning models — a **Transformer** and an **LSTM** — two models to predict psychosis-related outcomes in youth using brain imaging, demographic, and clinical data as features.

## Project Summary

- Built custom LSTM and Transformer models to analyze complex sequential and cross-sectional data.
- Focused on extracting meaningful patterns from temporal and snapshot data in this dataset.
- Dataset is private and not included.

## Models

- **LSTM:** Captures temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Transformer:** Uses attention mechanisms to model relationships across sequences.

## Results

Achieved strong predictive performance (details confidential due to dataset privacy).
